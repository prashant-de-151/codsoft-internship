# codsoft-internship

### Repo is for machine learning internship at Codsoft.

1. Task 1 movie John classification we created machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on the plot summary or texture information

2. We developed model to product customer care for a subscription based service or business we used historical customer data from kaggle dataset like uses behaviour and customer demographics and tried algorithms like logistic regression,random forest or gradient boost to predict churn

3. we build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate we used technique like TF idea for word embarrass with classifiers like Naive Bayes, logistic regression or support vector machine to identifies spam SMS
